Given psuedoCode:
function binaray_search(A,n,T) is 
    L := 0
    R := n-1
    while L<= R do 
        m := floor((L+R)/2)
        if A[m] < T Then
            L := m+1
        else A[m] < T then
            R := m-1
            
        else 
            return m 
    retur unsuccessful
    
    
here A denotes the list and n denotes its size. 

#Task 02
No, the given algorithm Won't be able to find the search value T=2 for the list.

Let's go through the steps of the algorithm:

Step 1:
L = 0, R = 7 (n-1)
m = floor((L + R) / 2) = floor((0 + 7) / 2) = floor(7 / 2) = 3

Step 2:
A[3] = 3 < T (2), so we update L = m + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4

Step 3:
L = 4, R = 7
m = floor((L + R) / 2) = floor((4 + 7) / 2) = floor(11 / 2) = 5

Step 4:
A[5] = 11 > T (2), so we update R = m - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4

Step 5:
L = 4, R = 4
m = floor((L + R) / 2) = floor((4 + 4) / 2) = floor(8 / 2) = 4

Step 6:
A[4] = 7 > T (2), so we update R = m - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3

Step 7:
L = 4, R = 3
Since L > R, the while loop terminates.

The algorithm did not find T=2 in the list. The reason for this is that the list is not sorted 
in ascending order, which is a requirement for binary search to work correctly. 
In the given list, the values are not arranged in a sorted order.

In the given list [23, 2, 19, 3, 7, 11, 5, 13], the elements are not arranged in ascending order. 
The presence of unsorted elements disrupts the assumptions binary search makes about the 
ordering of the list. As a result, the algorithm cannot accurately determine whether to search 
in the lower or upper half of the current range.

To use binary search effectively, the list should be sorted in ascending order beforehand. 
Once the list is sorted, binary search can efficiently locate the desired value by halving 
the search space at each step.
